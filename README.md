# skweez

skweez (pronounced like "squeeze") spiders web pages and extracts words for wordlist generation.

It is basically an attempt to make a more operator-friendly version of [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/cewl).
It is written in Golang, making it far more portable and performant than Ruby.
